# ATM_Machine_Program
### All programming and debugging were done through PyCharm
A program that replicates the functionality and behavior of an ATM machine.

When the program is executed, the user is first offered three choices: Login, Admin Login or Quit. <br><br>

If the user selects Login then they must input the correct username and password. The password and username are verified by comparing the inputs to the contents of the user.txt file. If both the username and password match, the user is authorized to enter. Else they have two more tries to enter the correct login information or else they go back to the main menu. <br><br> 

If the user successfully inserts the right username and password, then they offered the user menu which offers 5 options: Deposit, Withdraw, Print Receipt, Change PIN and Logout.
